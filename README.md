# Basic JS

I'm learning JS, this repo is meant to store some work I've been making in my journey.

## `notPublic`

You will notice there is a `notPublic` folder. This is because this files were just for practice and warm up, so should be taken as drafts.

## Bill calculator

This is very minimal JS and bootstrap base bill calculator. You can enter items to the bill, enter a discount and a tax percentage and finally calculate the bill.
